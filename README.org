#+TITLE: what_i_do and what_i_did

Simple tools to capture and analyze what I did on the computer.

There are many products that do this, but I could not find anything
that worked well on Linux X11.

* Capture
The [[./capture_what_i_do.py]] script captures the current session and outputs it as a JSON object.
[[./capture_and_archive_what_i_do]] is a cronjob wrapper that records the JSON object into files.
One file per calendar week.

I run the script every minute:
#+begin_example
*/1 * * * * chronic ~/bin/capture_and_archive_what_i_do
#+end_example

To better analyze some programs title strings, some changes make sense:

** Emacs
This adds the full filename to the emacs window title:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq-default frame-title-format "%b â‹„ %f")
#+end_src

* Analyze
To analyze a week or more load the JSON log files into a SQLite database with [[./whatidid_to_sqlite.py]].

For example:
#+begin_example
./whatidid_to_sqlite.py convert lastweek.sqlite3 ~/var/what_i_did/2023-KW05.log
#+end_example

Then run the excellent [[https://datasette.io][datasette]] on it:

#+begin_example
datasette --metadata metadata.yml lastweek.sqlite3
#+end_example
